Very simple balancing robot code for arduino. It's only dependency (apart from arduino itself) is the MPU6050_light library by rfetick (https://github.com/rfetick/MPU6050_light).
Robot hardware: Arduino nano, L293D, MPU6050, 2x "DC-motor with the yellow gearbox", some capacitors here and there would be advisable, some power source, (eg. lipo via linear regulator).
